# Project Aberration
Project Aberration is a Unity 2022.3.17f1 project for the [Acerola Jam 0](https://itch.io/jam/acerola-jam-0) with the theme of **Aberration**.

## Theme Interpretations
Based on the theme of **Aberrations** the following ideas were generated:

### **Mechanical Focus:** Text-Based x Metroidvania
You are a hacker in a post apocalyptic world, trapped within the bowls of a gargantuan megastructure. Your goal, reach the outside world, but to do so you must explore the environment as well as interface with special terminals in order to reach the outside world.

Along the way, you will solve puzzles, discover about the pre apocalypse world and escape the megastructure's defense systems.

### Dynamics Focus: Observed
A 2nd person game in which you play as a newly awoken adventurer that must travel a dungeon in search of killing the wizard that controls it, the catch is that you view the game from the perspective of the wizard and its various scrying devices in the dungeon.

Along the way, you must explore the dungeon defeating monsters and completing puzzles from the perspective of the wizard that created the dungeon.

The game will consist of a small number of scenes that build the dungeon, a main menu scene and two outro cinematics for the game, in the case of all player characters death (Game Over) or a player character has reached the mage that controls the dungeon.

### Dungeon
